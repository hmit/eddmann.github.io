Following on from our [first screencast]({% post_url 2015-08-03-php-extension-development-for-beginners-with-joe-watkins %}), which touched upon how to setup a PHP extension development environment and creating a simple 'array_sum' like function.

Throughout this discussion we look into creating a custom Zend object class, using this to invoke an implemented data-structure located in another file, implementing internal interfaces, object handlers and the importance of PHP extension tests.
