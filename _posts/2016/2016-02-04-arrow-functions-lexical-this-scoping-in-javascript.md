One feature of ES2015 that I feel can be a stumbling block (but extremely useful) is Arrow Functions lexical scoping of `this`.
Before this addition, every new function defined its own `this` - meaning we were required to explicitly bind or locally store the `this` reference that we desired in many use-cases.
<!--more-->
The two technique used to overcome this problem are highlighted below, using a locally stored `this` reference or a bound function.

{% highlight js %}
function Counter() {
  var _this = this;
  _this.counter = 0;
  this.inc = function () { _this.counter++; };
};
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
function Counter() {
  this.counter = 0;
  this.inc = function () { this.counter++; }.bind(this);
};
{% endhighlight %}

The contrived example usage below shows passing the counters `inc` method to a high-order function and asserting the desired `this` behavior.

{% highlight js %}
var c = new Counter();

setInterval(c.inc, 1000);
setInterval(function() { console.log(c.counter); }, 1500);
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
{% endhighlight %}

With the introduction of Arrow functions, the `this` value is instead captured based on the enclosing context, resulting in more readable code.

{% highlight js %}
function Counter() {
  this.counter = 0;
  this.inc = () => { this.counter++; }
};
{% endhighlight %}
