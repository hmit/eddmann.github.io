One item I feel that is missing from the Pokémon Generation 1 games are the [Running Shoes](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Running_Shoes).
When 'on' they increase the speed at which you move around the game.
You are able to achieve this with the [Bicycle](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bicycle), but this is only present later in the game.
In this post I will document how I simply added this running ability globally whilst the 'B button' is pressed.

Looking through the [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) source, I identified the logic surrounding moving the player around the game within [`home/overworld.asm`](https://github.com/eddmann/pokered/blob/running-shoes/home/overworld.asm#L276).

```diff
.moveAhead2
  ld hl, wFlags_0xcd60
  res 2, [hl]
+ ld a, [hJoyHeld]
+ and B_BUTTON
+ jr nz, .speedUp
  ld a, [wWalkBikeSurfState]
  dec a ; riding a bike?
  jr nz, .normalPlayerSpriteAdvancement
  ld a, [wd736]
  bit 6, a ; jumping a ledge?
  jr nz, .normalPlayerSpriteAdvancement
+ .speedUp
  call DoBikeSpeedup
  .normalPlayerSpriteAdvancement
  call AdvancePlayerSprite
```

With this small modification, if the 'B button' is pressed we jump directly to the new `speedUp` label which instructs the engine to perform the bike speedup.
This in-turn provides us with the ability to 'run' throughout the game, at the same speed as if you were on a bike.
